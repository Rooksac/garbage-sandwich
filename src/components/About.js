    Garbage Sandwich is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. 

We have emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and challenge, which has helped us develop unique and inventive sandwiches for the adventurous eater.

Our mission is to provide the tastiest sandwich experience utilizing the best ingredients and purveyors in the world.

We source our ingredients locally from some of our favorite sustainable farms and globally to sprinkle a sense of worldly adventure into every guest's experience. 

Zak, Danny, and I are incredibly proud of the customer experience we have created, and we hope that every guest of ours will have as much fun enjoying our crazy concoctions as we do making them! 

Keeping it Classy and Trashy -

Fred, Zak, and Danny
